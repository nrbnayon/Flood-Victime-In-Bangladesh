        <h1>Stands-up for the Flood Victims in Bangladesh</h1>
        <p>
          The flood situation in the country's northeast region has started to
          deteriorate as the water levels of three major rivers – Surma,
          Kushiyara, and Lova – are again on the rise due to water rushing down
          from upstream.

          Bangladesh is suffering right now as heavy monsoon rains have caused
          rivers to burst their banks. 2 million people in the North East of
          Bangladesh have been cut off and are relying on help to survive.

          <p>
            Increased access to education can contribute to reducing poverty.
            Acquired basic skills such as reading, writing and numeracy, have a
            documented positive effect on marginalized populations' incomes. It
            increases the rate of return on the economy.
